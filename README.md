# Accessible Popups

A case study examining the accessibility of cookie consent popups and implementing improved designs for inclusive user interaction.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes cookie consent popups from three major websites (Filmin, FIFA, and H&M) through the lens of accessibility. It examines how these components handle different input methods, present information to users, and support assistive technologies like screen readers.

The project is built with HTML and CSS for styling and responsive design.
